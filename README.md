Codes for “Functional Post-Clustering Selective Inference with Applications to EHR Data Analysis”

(1) The code for simulation studies can be found in 'Numerical Experiment.R'. This script includes the numerical results of the simulation study (Appendix C and Appendix D) and the illustrative flow chart (Figure 2).

(2) The code for real data analyses, titled 'Phenotyping of AKI based on EHR', can be found in the script 'Real Data Study.R'. This script includes the preprocessing of the AKI dataset and the computation of the results presented in Table 1 of the paper.

If you have any questions about this code, please contact Zihan Zhu (zihan.zhu@duke.edu), Xin Gai (xin.gai@duke.edu), and Anru Zhang (anru.zhang@duke.edu).
